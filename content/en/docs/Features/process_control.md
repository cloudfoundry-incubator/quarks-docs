## Background & Motivation

Before `kubecf` the processes of the jobs in an instance group were
managed by `monit`.

This allowed a human operator to suspend (kill) and later restart
these processes as a means of preventing them from interfering with
low-level operations like restoring a cluster using raw database
backups, and the like. Such suspensions were also not visible at kube
level as the pod and container kept running, except through live- and
readiness-probes.

The process control features added to the `containerun` helper
application of the operator serve the same purpose.

## Interface

The process control features of `containerrun` are accessible through
an unix domain __datagram__ socket at location
`/var/vcap/data/`__JOB__`/`__PROCESS__`_containerrun.sock` in the
container. Due to this placement the feature is not accessible from
outside a cluster. An operator (or script written by such) has to log
into the relevant container(s) to use the feature.

  - Suspending the monitored child processes is done by sending the
    command `STOP` to this socket.

  - Conversely, restarting the child processes is done by sending the
    command `START` to this socket.

  - Sending a `START` command when the child processes are running has
    no effect. Conversely the same is true for sending a `STOP`
    command when the child processes are suspended already.

  - Any other command sent to the socket is ignored.

Any tool able to send datagram packet to a unix domain socket of that
type should work.

Examples using `netcat`:

  - `echo START | nc -w 1 --unixsock --udp /var/vcap/data/JOB/PROCESS_containerrun.sock`
  - `echo STOP  | nc -w 1 --unixsock --udp /var/vcap/data/JOB/PROCESS_containerrun.sock`

Note that all of these sockets are placed in the volumne shared by all
container of all jobs of the instance group. It is enough to ssh into
__one__ of the containers to be able to send commands to __all__
sockets and thus jobs.

Example:

```
for sock in $(find /var/vcap/dataame '*_containerrun.sock')
do
    echo STOP | nc -w 1 --unixsock --udp $sock
done
```
