    This section contains design documents for the Kubernetes controllers that make up the quarks-operator

---

The `quarks-operator` watches four different types of custom resources:

* [BoshDeployment](bosh_deployment)
* [QuarksJob](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/quarks-job/blob/master/docs/quarksjob.md)
* [QuarksSecret](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/quarks-secret/blob/master/docs/quarks_secret.md)
* [QuarksStatefulSet](quarks_statefulset)

The `cf-operator` requires the according CRDs to be installed in the cluster in order to work as expected. By default, the `cf-operator` applies CRDs in your cluster automatically.

To verify that the CRDÂ´s are installed:

```bash
$ kubectl get crds
NAME                                            CREATED AT
boshdeployments.quarks.cloudfoundry.org        2019-06-25T07:08:37Z
quarksjobs.quarks.cloudfoundry.org           2019-06-25T07:08:37Z
quarkssecrets.quarks.cloudfoundry.org        2019-06-25T07:08:37Z
quarksstatefulsets.quarks.cloudfoundry.org   2019-06-25T07:08:37Z
```
