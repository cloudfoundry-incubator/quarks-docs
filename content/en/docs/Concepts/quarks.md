  Integrating Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes
---

[Project Quarks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-quarks/) is an incubating effort within the Cloud Foundry Foundation that packages Cloud Foundry Application Runtime as containers instead of virtual machines, enabling easy deployment to Kubernetes. 

The resulting containerized CFAR provides an identical developer experience to that of BOSH-managed Cloud Foundry installations, requires less infrastructure capacity and delivers an operational experience that is familiar to Kubernetes operators.
