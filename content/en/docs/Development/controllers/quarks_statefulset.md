## Description

The QuarksStatefulSet component can be understood as the set of controllers responsible for translating the BOSH manifest `instance_groups` into Kubernetes resources.

## QuarksStatefulset Component

The **QuarksStatefulset** component is a categorization of a set of controllers, under the same group. Inside the **QuarksStatefulset** component, we have a set of 2 controllers together with one separate reconciliation loop per controller.

Figure 1 illustrates a **QuarksStatefulset** component diagram that covers the set of controllers it uses.

### **_QuarksStatefulSet Controller_**

![qsts-controller-flow](../quarks_estscontroller_flow.png)
*Fig. 2: The QuarksStatefulset controller*

This controller will generate a Kubernetes statefulset for each `instance_group` defined in the BOSH manifest. This `Statefulset` will also include a set of Kubernetes services, so that each component can be accessed on specific ports.

#### Watches in sts controller

- `QuarksStatefulset`: Creation
- `Configmaps`: Update
- `Secrets`: Update

#### Reconciliation in sts controller

Will generate versioned `Statefulsets` with the required data to make all jobs of the `instance_group` runnable.

#### Scaling Restrictions (not implemented)

Ability to set restrictions on how scaling can occur: min, max, odd replicas.

#### Automatic Restart of Containers

When an env value or mount changes due to a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` change, containers are restarted.
The operator watches all the `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` referenced by the `StatefulSet`, and automatically performs the update, without extra workarounds.

#### Exposing QuarksStatefulSets Publicly

Exposing `quarksstatefulsets` is similar to exposing `statefulsets` in kubernetes. A Kubernetes service makes use of labels to select the pods which should be in the service. We need to use two labels to group the pods of a single instance group.

1. `quarks.cloudfoundry.org/instance-group-name: ((instanceGroupName))`
2. `quarks.cloudfoundry.org/deployment-name: ((deploymentName))`

#### Cluster IP

Following is the example which creates a service with type **ClusterIP** for a single instance group named `nats` in deployment `nats-deployment` for exposing port 4222.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nats-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    quarks.cloudfoundry.org/instance-group-name: nats
    quarks.cloudfoundry.org/deployment-name: nats-deployment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 4222
```

Complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/tree/master/docs/examples/bosh-deployment/boshdeployment-with-service.yaml).

Though, by default, quarks creates three services of type **ClusterIP** as defined [here](../../core-tasks/from_bosh_to_kube/#naming-conventions) for any instance group.

#### Load Balancer

For creating a service type **LoadBalancer**, we just need to change the `.spec.type` to `LoadBalancer` in the above example. The LoadBalancer Ingress is your public IP specified in the output of this command `kubectl describe service nats-service`.

#### Ingress

**Ingress** doesn't use any labels but just sits on top of services and acts as a smart router. You can create services of different types based on the above examples and use them as values in the ingress Kubernetes spec. An example of Ingress can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/#create-an-ingress-resource)

For more information about Kubernetes services, we recommend you to read [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

#### Extended Upgrade Support

When an update needs to happen, a second `StatefulSet` for the new version is deployed, and both coexist until canary conditions are met.

Annotated with a version (auto-incremented on each update). The annotation key is `quarks.cloudfoundry.org/version`.

Ability to upgrade even though `StatefulSet` pods are not ready.

#### Detects if StatefulSet versions are running

During upgrades, there is more than one `StatefulSet` version for an `QuarksStatefulSet` resource. The operator lists available versions and keeps track of which are running.

A running version means that at least one pod that belongs to a `StatefulSet` is running. When a version **n** is running, any version lower than **n** is deleted.

The controller continues to reconcile until there's only one version.

#### AZ Support

The `zones` key defines the availability zones the `QuarksStatefulSet` needs to span.

The `zoneNodeLabel` defines the node label that defines a node's zone.
The default value for `zoneNodeLabel` is `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`.

The example below defines an `QuarksStatefulSet` that should be deployed in two availability zones, **us-central1-a** and **us-central1-b**.

```yaml
apiVersion: quarks.cloudfoundry.org/v1alpha1
kind: QuarksStatefulSet
metadata:
  name: MyQuarksStatefulSet
spec:
  zoneNodeLabel: "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone"
  zones: ["us-central1-a", "us-central1-b"]
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      replicas: 2
  ...
```

The `QuarksStatefulSet` controller creates one `StatefulSet` version for each availability zone, and adds affinity information to the pods of those `StatefulSets`:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone"
          operator: In
          values: ["us-central1-a"]
```

If zones are set for an `QuarksStatefulSet`, the following occurs:

- The name of each created `StatefulSet` is generated as `<quarks statefulset name>-z<index of az>`.

  ```text
  myquarksstatefulset-z0
  ```

- The `StatefulSet` and its `Pods` are labeled with the following:

  ```yaml
  quarks.cloudfoundry.org/az-index: "0"
  quarks.cloudfoundry.org/az-name: "us-central1-a"
  ```

- The `StatefulSet` and its `Pods` are annotated with an **ordered** JSON array of all the availability zones:

  ```yaml
  quarks.cloudfoundry.org/zones: '["us-central1-a", "us-central1-b"]'
  ```

- As defined above, each pod is modified to contain affinity rules.
- Each container and init container of each pod have the following env vars set:

  ```shell
  KUBE_AZ="zone name"
  BOSH_AZ="zone name"
  CF_OPERATOR_AZ="zone name"
  AZ_INDEX="zone index"
  ```

##### Tolerations

Taints and tolerations is a concept defined in kubernetes to repel pods from nodes [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/). Defining tolerations is same as defined in the kubernetes docs. Keep in mind the affinity rules added by the controller when az's are defined. An example is specified in the examples folder.

#### Restarting on Config Change

`QuarksStatefulSets` can be automatically updated when the environment/mounts have changed due to a referenced
`ConfigMap` or a `Secret` being updated. This behavior is controlled by the `updateOnConfigChange` flag which defaults to `false`.

#### Watches in cleanup controller

- `StatefulSet`: Creation/Update

#### Reconciliation in cleanup controller

It will delete statefulsets with old versions, only after the new statefulset version instances are up and running.

### **_QuarksStatefulSet Active-Passive Controller_**

![qsts-activepassivecontroller-flow](../quarks_estsactivepassivecontroller_flow.png)
*Fig. 3: The QuarksStatefulset active/passive controller*

Active/passive model is application model that have multiple running instances, but only one instance is active and all other instances are passive (standby). If the active instance is down, one of the passive instances will be promoted to active immediately.

The `activePassiveProbes` key defines active probe to be performed on a container. The controller examines the active probe periodically to see if the active one is still active. If active pod is down or there isnâ€™t an active pod, the first running pod will be promoted as active and label it as `quarks.cloudfoundry.org/pod-active: active`.

```yaml
apiVersion: quarks.cloudfoundry.org/v1alpha1
kind: QuarksStatefulSet
metadata:
  name: myquarksstatefulset
spec:
  activePassiveProbes:
    busybox:
      # define a active probe on the container
      exec:
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - /root/check-active.sh
  template:
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: busybox
            image: busybox
            command:
            - sleep
            - "3600"
  ...
```

The controller manages this active probing and provides pod designation label to the service's selectors. Any requests sent to the service will then only be sent to the active pod.


## Relationship with the BDPL component

![bpm-qsts-relationship](../quarks_bpm_and_ests_flow.png)
*Fig. 4: Relationship with the BPM controller*

Figure 4 illustrates the interaction of the **BPM** Controller with the **QuarksStatefulSet** Controller. Once the BPM controller consumes the data persisted in secrets from the `QuarksJob` Component, it will use that data to generate new `QuarksStatefulset` instances. When these resources are generated, the QuarksStatefulSet controller will be watching and trigger its reconciliation loop.
