## Tests description

Based on upstreams documentation https://github.com/thtanaka/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/devel/testing.md we use three levels of testing: `unit`, `integration` and `e2e`.

Before starting, run `make tools` to install the required dependencies.

Running `make test` executes all the test suites.

We use ginkgo for testing. Every package needs a `suite_test.go` for setup. It can be generated by running `ginkgo bootstrap` in the sub folder. Rename the generated file afterwards, to stay consistent.
There is also `ginkgo generate` to create skeleton test files.

## Unit

While unit testing we:

- test classes in isolation
- pass all dependencies to the constructor, so we can inject fakes for testing
- use `counterfeiter` and `gomock`/`mockgen` to generate and update fakes and mocks
- don't test private methods, tests are in a separate `_test` package
- try not to nest ginkgo contexts too deep and keep tests DRY by extracting useful helpers
- assert incoming messages produce the expected state
- assert outgoing commands happened, like a file gets written
- assert all handled error cases are triggered
- can ignore outgoing queries, which only change internal state

### Setup Ruby

Ruby gem for template rendering

```bash
gem install bosh-template
```

## Integration

Integration tests formulate expectations on the interactions of several components.
They require access to a Kubernetes, preferably `minikube`.

Integration tests start our operator directly, bypassing the command line.
They do require the operator [docker image](#upload-operator-image) and the `bosh-template` Ruby gem.

The `environment` package provides helpers to start the operator, get the kubeconfig and use the clients to create objects.
In `testing` the `catalog` defines test objects.

Integration tests use a special logger, which does not log to stdout and whose messages can be accessed as a an array by calling `env.AllLogMessages()`.

When using `bin/test-integration` the integration tests are run in parallel.
Each Ginkgo test node has a separate namespace, log file and webhook server port and certificate.

The node index starts at 1 and is used as following to generate names:

```bash
namespace: $TEST_NAMESPACE + <node_index>
webhook port: $CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_PORT + <node_index>
log file: $CF_OPERATOR_TESTING_TMP/cf-operator-tests-<node_index>.log
```

Integration tests use the `TEST_NAMESPACE` environment variable as a base to
calculate the namespace name. Test namespaces are deleted automatically once
the tests are completed.

`CF_OPERATOR_TESTING_TMP` can be used to set a tmp directory for storing logs
and other files generated during testing. If this variable is not set `/tmp`
will be used instead.

The tests will create some NodePort services; normally the test can detect an IP
address automatically. `CF_OPERATOR_NODE_IP` can set to the node IP of any
arbitrary node to override this (e.g. for OpenStack Kubernetes clusters).

Generated files will be cleand up after the test run unless `SKIP_CF_OPERATOR_TESTING_TMP_CLEANUP`
is set to `true`.

### **Webhook Configuration**

Quarks StatefulSet requires a k8s webhook to mutate the volumes of a pod.
Kubernetes will call back to the operator for certain requests and use the
modified pod manifest, which is returned.
CF-Operator also uses a validating webhook to validate the BOSH deployment spec and the creation
of reference resources specified in the spec. Secret validation admission webhook restricts the 
user from updating a versioned secret.

The cf-operator integration tests use `CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_PORT` as a
base value to calculate the port number to listen to on `CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST`.

The tests use a `mutatingwebhookconfiguration` and a `validatingwebhookconfiguration` to configure Kubernetes to
connect to this address. The address needs to be reachable from the cluster.

The configuration only applies to a single namespace, by using a selector. It contains the URL of the webhooks, build from
`CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST` and the calculated port.
It also contains SSL certificates and CA, which are necessary to connect to the webhook.

The certificates and keys are written to disk, so the webhook server can use
them.  They are also cached in a k8s secret for production, but that is not
being used in integration tests, since they delete the test namespaces.

Tests suites should clean up their, namespace dependant, webhook configuration automatically.

## End-to-End

The e2e tests are meant to test acceptance scenarios. They are written from an end user perspective.
They are split into two types, 'cli' and 'kube'.

The e2e CLI test exercise different command line options and commands which don't need a running Kubernetes, like template rendering.
The CLI tests build the operator binary themselves.

The second type of e2e tests use `helm` to install the CF operator into the k8s cluster and use the files from `docs/examples` for testing.

## Running tests

### In minikube

The following steps are necessary to have a proper environment setup, where all types of tests can be executed:

1. Start `minikube`

    ```bash
    minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.15.5
    ```

1. Switch to minikube docker daemon

    ```bash
    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    ```

    _**Note**_: Template rendering for BOSH jobs is done at deployment time by the operator
    binary. Therefore the operator docker image needs to be made available to
    Kubernetes cluster.


1. Export the `CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST` env variable

    ```bash
    export CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST=$(ip -4 a s dev $(ip r l 0/0 | cut -f5 -d' ') | grep -oP 'inet \K\S+(?=/)')
    ```

    _**Note**_: On Mac, use `export CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST=$(ip a s $(ip r g 0/0 | cut -f5 -d' ') | grep -oE 'inet [^ /]+' | cut -f2 -d' ')`, because grep cannot handle perl regexs.
    _**Note**_: You can also find the correct IP, by running `ip addr`. The IP address under `vboxnet1` is the IP that you need.

1. Export the `OPERATOR_TEST_STORAGE_CLASS` env variable

    ```bash
    export OPERATOR_TEST_STORAGE_CLASS=standard
    ```

    _**Note**_: Require for the PVC test creation, in minikube.

1. Ensure `GO111MODULE` is set

    ```bash
    export GO111MODULE=on
    ```

    _**Note**_: When you have a vendor folder (either from the submodule or manually created) settings this to `off` speeds up the `build-image` target.

1. Build the `cf-operator` binary

    ```bash
    bin/build
    ```

1. Build the `cf-operator` docker image

    ```bash
    bin/build-image
    ```

_**Note**_: Consider setting `DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG` to a fixed variable. This will avoid rebuilding the docker image everytime, when doing changes in files not related to the `cf-operator`
binary.

_**Note**_: When not running in CI, nothing ensures a proper cleanup of resources after the deletion of the `cf-operator` in the environment. You can make sure to manually verify that none
old resources will interfere with a future installation, by:

```bash
# Deleting old mutating webhooks configurations
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration -oname | xargs -n 1 kubectl delete
```

### In KinD

The following steps are necessary to have a proper environment setup, where all types of tests can be executed:

1. Install `KinD`

Follow the instructions from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/

1. Start cluster

    ```bash
    kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.15.6
    ```

1. Export the `CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST` env variable. Use the IP of the docker bridge or your public IP. Firewall rules may interfere.

    ```bash
    export CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST=$(ip -4 a s dev $(ip r l 0/0 | cut -f5 -d' ') | grep -oP 'inet \K\S+(?=/)')
    ```

_**Note**_: On Mac, use `export CF_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SERVICE_HOST=$(ip a s $(ip r g 0/0 | cut -f5 -d' ') | grep -oE 'inet [^ /]+' | cut -f2 -d' ')`, because grep cannot handle perl regexs.


1. Export the `OPERATOR_TEST_STORAGE_CLASS` env variable

    ```bash
    export OPERATOR_TEST_STORAGE_CLASS=standard
    ```

    _**Note**_: Required for the PVC tests.

1. Build the `cf-operator` docker image

    First set the version to something static, not dependant on git:

    ```bash
    export DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=${DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG:-dev}
    ```

    ```bash
    bin/build-image
    ```

    Or if you have local changes and use `go mod edit --replace`,
    follow instructions from [development](../../development/development#standalone-components).

1. Load image into KinD

    ```
    kind load docker-image cfcontainerization/cf-operator:$DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG
    ```

1. Set QuarksJob dependency. Choose a tag from [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/cfcontainerization/quarks-job/tags).

    ```
    export QUARKS_JOB_IMAGE_TAG=${QUARKS_JOB_IMAGE_TAG:-dev}
    ```

    If using a locally built quarks-job image, load it via

    ```kind load docker-image cfcontainerization/quarks-job:$QUARKS_JOB_IMAGE_TAG```

    (see [development](../../development/development#standalone-components)).

## Makefile

The following are the make targets available and their actions. When building and running the targets manually on the quarks-operator codebase, please set `PROJECT=quarks-operator`.

The common scripts between the `quarks-operator` components are in the `quarks-utils` [project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/quarks-utils/). To download them, make sure to run `bin/tools-shared` or `make tools` before running any other script/target.
